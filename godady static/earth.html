                Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited
                by living things.
            </p>

            <p>
                While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar
                system with liquid
                water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets
                closest to the
                Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

                The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek
                and Roman gods
                and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”

               <h4> Size and Distance</h4>
                With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the
                fifth largest planet overall.

                From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical
                unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun
                to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
